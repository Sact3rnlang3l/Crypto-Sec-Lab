In the end of 2011 Sony came out to the public informing
 them that there was a major data breach, 
 and they would be temporarily suspending services for their PlayStation Network. 
 
 Before the shutdown and breach there had been a week-long attack 
 by the group called Anonymous using Ddos tactics to overwhelm the servers and infrastructure.
  This attack was mainly due to a decision Sony had made, but was not the actual breach. 
  There have been two main avenues the system could have been breached. 
  During the week-long attack the group Anonymous could easily have found a loop into the system, or set up a way for an easy SQL injection. 
The other Theory is that using some new developer tools recently released,
 a gateway into internal Sony systems was easily accessed and exploited.
Either way an unknown group was able to get into the internal servers,
 where they found unencrypted private information of at least 2500 individuals,
  including sensitive information. 

Sony has since closed the access into their internal networks using the Dev tools, 
and started to encrypt all information regarding individuals using their online services, 
and their accounts. There have been further attempts over the years, emboldened by this initial massive attack.
